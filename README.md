# Shop-Application
An application for testing products from the shop such as lipsticks and shirts using AI and Image Processing.

The application uses the webcamera of a user to display in real time how a certain lipstick or shirt is going to look 
on it. The app is written in Python and it uses OpenCv for the image processing part, PyQt5 for building the GUI, while 
the model for detecting the lips and the upper body part is custom trained using Dlib's shape predictor.
